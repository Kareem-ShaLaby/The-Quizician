#          {mid, year, module, subject} REFERENCES, not full question

#          file is quizician_storage_backup.json (singular, no year
#          suffix) — do NOT confuse with each year's Quizician_Quiz_Backup
#          file below, despite the similar "storage/backup" wording.
# 1986   QUIZ CHANNELS (per-year: YEARS registry near the top of the file
#          controls channel_id + curriculum per year; index/state/poll-status/
#          backup are all keyed by year, e.g. QUIZ_INDEX[year]). Each

#          Quizician_Quiz_Backup_Y1.json / _Y2.json / _Y3.json
#          (backup_quiz_to_channel) and contains quiz_index + quiz_state +
#          quiz_poll_status for that year — this is what MISTAKES BANK
#          entries resolve against.
# 2212   STATE (in-memory dicts: LECTURE_SESSIONS, QUIZ_POLL_STATUS, etc. —
#          all purely in-memory, NOT persisted/restored across a restart;
#          a crash mid-finals-night silently drops everyone's active
#          quiz/lecture session)
# 2238   CONSTANTS
# 2247   PER-USER SERIALIZATION — @_serialize_per_user decorator, applied
#          to handle_poll_answer and button_handler. Needed because
#          concurrent_updates() (see MAIN, near the bottom) lets different
#          users' updates run truly concurrently now; this keeps each
#          individual user's own updates ordered against each other via a
#          private asyncio.Lock per user_id, without touching either
#          handler's body.

#          callback_data routing, including lecture preview/leaderboard,
#          lecture start, and settings toggles)
# 5280   PDF/DOCX EXPORT (single source of truth, called from both PDF
#          commands and quiz-channel exports)
# 5397   PDF COMMANDS
# 5437   START (also wakes bot from sleep; asks for a nickname on first use)
# 5505   ADMIN HELPERS
# 5526   BROADCAST COMMAND (admin only)
# 5603   MAIN — ApplicationBuilder here sets .concurrent_updates(256), so
#          updates from different users are handled in parallel instead of
#          one-at-a-time globally (see PER-USER SERIALIZATION above for
#          how same-user ordering is still preserved). Also where
#          _reconcile_backups_job lives: a job_queue.run_repeating() job
#          (every BACKUP_RECONCILE_INTERVAL seconds) that re-checks each
#          backup channel's pin and re-uploads if it's out of sync, so a
#          missed pin/delete on the reactive path gets caught within a few
#          seconds instead of waiting for the next real data change.
#
# NOTE ON save_*() FUNCTIONS: all 11 are async, writing via
# asyncio.to_thread(_atomic_write_json, ...) — atomic (temp file + fsync +
# os.replace, so a crash can't leave a half-written JSON file) AND
# non-blocking (the disk I/O runs in a worker thread instead of stalling
# the event loop for every other user while one save is in flight). Every
# call site must `await` them; a few originally-sync helper functions
# (_record_activity, set_daily_quiz_scope, _record_lecture_result,
# record_mistake, _index_item) became async too since they call save_*()
# internally — grep any of these names before adding a new call site.
#
# NOTE: line numbers drift as the file grows — treat them as "roughly
# here", and confirm with a grep for the section banner text if unsure.

# ── YEARS — one quiz channel + curriculum per academic year ──────────

# modules -> subjects -> lectures, exactly like before. Each year is
# completely isolated: its own Telegram channel, its own quiz index, its
# own backup document. That isolation is the whole point — a single
# combined index/backup eventually outgrows Telegram's practical JSON
# document size as more years/lectures pile in, so splitting by year
# keeps each backup small indefinitely instead of one ever-growing file.
#
# To add/wire up a year's channel:
#   1. Create a channel, add this bot as an ADMIN (channels require admin
#      rights for the bot to receive posts at all).
#   2. Forward any message from that channel to the bot in a private DM,
#      then send /quiz_channel_id right after — the bot replies with the ID.

# below, repurposed and started fresh — its lecture index/state/poll-status
# are stored under new "_y3" files, so nothing from the old combined

#
# Subject names here are plain text, no emoji — this is the exact string
# admins type in a lecture title ("<Module> - <Subject> Lecture <n>: ...")
# and the exact string stored in QUIZ_INDEX, so it needs to stay simple and
# typeable. Emoji are purely cosmetic and live in SUBJECT_EMOJI below,
# looked up only when rendering a subject as a button label.

# options/correct_option_id/explanation) is resolved on demand via
# _snapshot_from_mid, which reads QUIZ_POLL_STATUS[year] — the same data
# that's durably backed up per year in that year's quiz backup document

# options on every miss, which made mistakes_bank.json grow unbounded.
#
# Trade-off vs. the old self-contained design: a mistake now stops
# resolving if its specific question message is later deleted (not just
# edited — QUIZ_POLL_STATUS keeps content fine for edited/closed
# questions). _resolve_mistake prunes any entry that no longer resolves
# the moment it's looked up, so the bank self-cleans instead of

# DAILY QUIZ — 💥Daily Quiz💥: 7 random questions pulled from random
# subjects (any subject can contribute more than one — this is not a
# one-per-subject pick), plus 3 random questions from the shared
# MISTAKES_BANK. Both slices are restricted to the admin-set /daily_module
# scope when one is set (see get_daily_quiz_scope), or span every
# configured year/module otherwise. Pushed to everyone at 2pm Cairo time
# once a day (see the job_queue.run_daily call in MAIN); the push itself
# is just a button — tapping it is what actually starts the quiz and is
# gated to once per person per day via each user's settings

# doesn't make sense for a session mixing many years/lectures/subjects at
# once. A Daily Quiz question is fully self-contained (question/options/
# correct_id baked in directly, same shape as a MISTAKES_BANK entry) so

# /report_issue — user sends a message, admin replies from
# REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID, both sides visible on the same message, and the
# reporter can send follow-ups back into the same thread.
#
# Flow:
#   1. /report_issue -> AWAITING_REPORT_ISSUE[user_id] = True, bot asks for the text.
#   2. Next text message from that user (caught in handle()) is the report.
#      Posted to REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID with a "↩️ Reply" button, and
#      recorded in REPORT_THREADS keyed by that group message's id — this
#      id is also shown on the card itself as the "Reply ID".
#   3. Admin replies one of two ways:
#        a) Type "-Reply <id> <text>" directly in the group. Preferred —
#           parsed straight out of the message text with no per-user
#           state, so it works even if the group has "remain anonymous"
#           enabled for admins (a typed message then arrives with
#           effective_user = GroupAnonymousBot, not the admin's real id,
#           which silently breaks any flow keyed on real_uid).
#        b) Tap the "↩️ Reply" button -> AWAITING_REPORT_REPLY[admin_id]
#           = {...}, bot asks for the text in the group, and the admin's
#           next message there is picked up in handle(). Kept as a
#           convenience alongside (a), with a same-chat fallback lookup
#           for the anonymous-admin case — see the comment at that check.
#      Either way: appended to the thread via _append_report_message, DM'd
#      to the user with their own "↩️ Reply" button, and the group message
#      is edited to show the full thread so far plus fresh Reply/Close
#      buttons.
#   4. Reporter taps their own "↩️ Reply" -> AWAITING_USER_FOLLOWUP[user_id]
#      = {...}; their next DM text is appended to the same thread (shown
#      to the admin under their name) and the group message is refreshed.
#      Blocked once the thread is closed.
#   5. Close just strips the buttons and marks the thread closed — no
#      further replies possible from that message (a re-tapped Reply, from
#      either side, is rejected with a toast/message).
#
# REPORT_THREADS is persisted the same way as MISTAKES_BANK: a local JSON
# file plus a pinned backup in REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID, restored on startup
# (see restore_report_threads_from_channel). A restart mid-thread no
# longer loses the ability to keep replying to an old report — the thread
# reloads from the channel backup before polling starts.

# Every backup_*_to_channel() call above is reactive and fire-and-forget:
# it fires once, right after a data change, and any failure in the
# upload/pin/delete-old-pin sequence is only logged, never retried.
# Almost always fine — but a dropped pin call or a delete that silently
# fails (message already gone, a transient timeout, etc.) can leave the
# channel's pinned message out of sync with what's actually on disk,
# and nothing would notice until the NEXT change came along to trigger
# another reactive backup.
#
# This job runs on a short timer instead of waiting for the next change:
# every BACKUP_RECONCILE_INTERVAL seconds, for each backup system
# (analytics, settings, lecture results, storage, and each configured
# year's quiz index), it checks whether the channel's current pin still
# matches the caption marker we expect. If the pin is missing, or belongs
# to a different marker (e.g. our own backup got unpinned by someone, or a
# delete-old-pin call left a stale one pinned instead), it just re-runs
# that system's normal backup_*_to_channel() — which re-uploads,
# re-pins, and cleans up the old message the same way it always does.
# Cheap: one get_chat per system per tick, and the throttle inside each
# backup_*_to_channel() call means this never spams uploads if
# everything's already fine.

# when quiz-channel questions/lectures get pinned) causes Telegram to post
# a "The Quizician pinned a file" service message in that chat.
# disable_notification only silences the push notification, it doesn't
# stop the message itself — so we delete it on sight in the bot's own
# chats. Restricted to chats the bot actually pins in; if a human admin
# pins something else in one of these, its service message gets deleted
# too, since Telegram doesn't tell us who did the pinning.
